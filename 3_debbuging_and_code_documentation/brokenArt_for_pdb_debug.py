Warning: This code is broken. Don't treat it as model code for your work.

This code generates random pixel art. The values are all integers drawn from a
random uniform distribution. The range of the random distribution increases as 
we go up in the image. We also will log how many times each integer is hit.  

# Topics we'll cover:
# - pdb
# - setting up debugging configuration in VSCode
# - post mortem debugging
# - breakpoints/conditional breakpoints
# - stepping through lines
# - debug console
# - How to use this when developing for large packages.
